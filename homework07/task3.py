"""
Write a function that takes directory path, a file extension and an optional tokenizer.
It will count lines in all files with that extension if there are no tokenizer.
If a the tokenizer is not none, it will count tokens.

For dir with two files from hw1.py:
>>> universal_file_counter(test_dir, "txt")
6
>>> universal_file_counter(test_dir, "txt", str.split)
6
